Python chessbot using Reinforcement Learning

Introducing a chessbot developed in Python utilizing reinforcement learning techniques. This bot is the product of a research project for school, aiming to investigate the possibility of creating a chessbot using these advanced techniques. It utilizes various Reinforcement Learning methods to train the bot on its own, by playing games against itself, without relying on pre-existing datasets. This research aims to explore the possibilities of AI development in the game of chess and will be an exciting learning experience for me and anyone interested in AI.
